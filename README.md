# Currents-20
This repository contains code for a Line Follower robot written in arduino. This code is being written and used by me in CURRENTS'20 Line Follower robotic event of National Institute of Technology Trichy (NIT-TRICHY) annual EEE branch symposium. 



# Speciality of Robot
1. PD of PID is used for control algorithm.
2. Even if robot loose it's path (line) during sharp turns ,then also it will continue towards approaching the line based on previous encounter of line.
